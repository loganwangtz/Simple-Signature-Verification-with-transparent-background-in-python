# Simple-Signature-Verification-with-transparent-background-in-python
This project performs simple signature verification with SVM, the signatures are generated with a web tool and thus have transparent background.  The images are cropped into 28*28 so that only the center is use for training. With square shaped signature and non-overlapping pattern, this model can achieve high performance (>98%) in verifying the genuine and forged signatures.
